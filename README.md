# Main Dev

This repo is dedicated to my single page web apps, programming and other scripting. WIPs may or may not be included -- if a project gets abandoned, it will be put up here because there is no more work being done on it, so maybe someone wants to pick it up.

## APPS LIST

### WebAmp.html

* a retro audio visualizer that is like winamp or windows media player of yore

### SAK.bat

* a (S)wiss (A)rmy (K)nife for common computer troubleshooting. Basic, but useful for my job.

### ping.php

* continually pings with 1 packet just to see if theres a connection to a certain server. I needed this to test my mesh vpn network from within my server stack already. Basically, it checks to see if the server itself can check for an address.

### critterlog.php

* using a map to track animal sightings. Primarily made to share with my family so they can track for hunting and fishing on a shared map.

### sysData.php

* server infomrational dashboard

### PromptForge.html

* was going to be a browser based markdown editor, but I didnt really like how it turned out so I abandoned it.

### WarpCore.html

* a very inaccurate benchmarking tool.
